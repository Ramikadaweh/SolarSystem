          <p>
            Solar energy is the most abundant of all energy resources and can
            even be harnessed in cloudy weather.The rate at which solar energy
            is intercepted
            <br /> by the Earth is about 10,000 times greater than the rate at
            which humankind consumes energy.

            <p>
              With most sunlight conversion efficiency.
              <br />A solar cell panel, solar electric panel, photo-voltaic
              module or solar panel is an assembly of photo-voltaic cells
              mounted in a framework for installation. Solar panels use sunlight
              as a source of energy to generate direct current electricity.

              failures in the future. Put simply, it's about fixing things

              Upgrading is the process of replacing a product with a newer
              version of the same product. In computing and consumer electronics
              an upgrade is generally a replacement of hardware, software or
              firmware with a newer or better version, in order to bring the
              system up to date or to improve its characteristics.
